			<h2>About this WebApp</h2>
			<p>
				It came about as I'd read about HTML5 storage and was already working on web apps that could be used locally (in an Intranet). It seemed a natural fit to work on something that would naturally allow me to actually use local storage but be on an Internet site (rather than local), but still maintain some of those benefits.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Privacy</h2>
			<p>
				An intranet environment, unless exposed in a certain manner is somewhat more secure than an internet site; but with local storage, it actually stores data on the user's (that would be you) browser; that does introduce some other problems but as such I don't need to worry about handling your data beyond providing a nice interface for you to use.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The only information I will ever glean from your usage of this site is what is necessary for you to visit it, your IP address and other related information that your browser may send (unless you have taken steps to hide your actual IP address or that data). 
			</p>
			
			<h2>JavaScript and Data</h2>
			<p>
				JavaScript is used in this instance to provide the interactivity, allowing you to customise your layout and add things to your lists; no data at any point (unless specified otherwise) is sent back to the server&#133; I may in the future add features that may temporarily store information locally; but only for your own end use and as an ease-of-use feature, but alternatives will always be available.
