			<p>
				As with many ideas, it was reading something not-too-recently
				and a suggestion from a friend that sparked this project off.
				A customisable homepage that doesn't use the server for anything
				aside from the markup and javascript to make it happen.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course reality is never quite so easy, unfortunately not
				every site has the most modern web technology deployed - so for
				certain widgets the app does still have to rely on the server,
				where possible trying to limit this&#133; and provide alternatives.
			</p>

			<h4>Status</h4>
			<p>
				AptoDomus is in <strong>alpha</strong>, which means new features
				will be added and changes may occur. Though I feel like it is
				now at a stage where the basics are there and the public can begin
				using it.
			</p>


			<h3>The Name</h3>
			<p>
				AptoDomus is made up of two latin words: Apto, meaning adjustable
				and Domus, meaning home. Plus it seems to ring nicely.
			</p>

			<h3>Privacy</h3>
			<p>
				This site uses localStorage, an allocated amount of space assigned
				to <em>your</em> browser on <em>your</em> device. It is not
				visible to other users on other computers; as such if you clear
				the correct browser cache any customisations may be lost.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only information I will ever glean from your usage of this
				site is what is necessary for you to visit it, your IP address
				and other related information that your browser may send.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some features may require more interaction with the local server,
				where this is the case the widgets will be marked with an asterisk.
				Primarily this involves RSS or XML feeds, if a JSON alternative
				is not made available.
			</p>

			<h3>JavaScript and Data</h3>
			<p>
				JavaScript is used in this instance to provide the interactivity,
				allowing you to customise your layout and add things to your
				lists; no data at any point (unless specified otherwise in the
				<a href="docs/">documentation</a>) is sent back to the
				server&#133; I may in the future add features that may
				temporarily store information or require handling of data, but I
				 fully intend to avoid it as much as possible; the features
				would only be for your own end use, and provide warning of this.
			</p>

		</p>

			<h3>Planned Features</h3>

			<p>
				This is no guarantee these features may appear either soon or
				indefinitely; some may not even be technically possible.
