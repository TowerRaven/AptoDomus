# AptoDomus

AptoDomus is an adjustable homepage, built using HTML5 using localStorage and a
big dollop of JavaScript. The aim is to make a homepage that doesn't need anything
stored online and interacts with the server minimally; while also hopefully being
stylish and easy on the eye.

It is licenced under the **GNU GPL V2**.

## Live Site
Coming soon.

## Source Code
The latest version can be found on the
